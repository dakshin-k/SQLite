# SQLite

For Agriculture

An app displaying crops related information to govt. officials who can then advice farmers on what crops to grow etc.
While MainActivity contains code using SQL Databases, the final version of this app does not use SQL. Instead data is hard coded into XML files as the data being displayed is not expected to change/be updated.

Built in less than a day for a hackathon.
