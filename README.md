#SQLite

For Agriculture

An app displaying crops related information to govt. officials who can then advice farmers on what crops to grow etc.
While MainActivity contains code using SQL Databases, the final version of this app does not use SQL at all.

Built in less than a day for a hackathon, so please don't judge my coding style from this!
